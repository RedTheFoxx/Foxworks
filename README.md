Tools and various projects along my low-level adventure.
Working mainly with Python for professional purposes but my personnal experiences are more C, C++ and Assembly oriented (because Reverse Engineering)

I'm currently focusing on Malware Devlopment and Red Teaming.

*All my code can be reused without limits, but please link back to my repos!*
